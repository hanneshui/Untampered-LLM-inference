# Untampered-LLM-inference

Prompt Generator built by Wendelin Stark & Hannes Hui (ETH Zurich) to check if an LLM model is untampered.

## Overview

This project fetches the latest bitcoin block hash. An unpredictable, tamper-proof seed - and uses it to deterministically generate a word prompt for LLM inference. The prompt is generated from shuffled sentences sampled from a large pre-downloaded corpus, ensuring that the same hash always produces the same prompt. 

A second script compares the similarity of the LLM outputs generated by two identical prompts. This is used to check whether the LLMs used for inference have been manipulated and modified, i.e. monetarised, personalised or censored.
